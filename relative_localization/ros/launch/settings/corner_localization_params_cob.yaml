# frame which is used to filter out wall points, it can be assigned with an existing frame or a yet unknown frame
# Existing frame: Polygons for detection wall points will be build upon the assigned existing frame (e.g. robot's base)
# Unknown frame: A new frame will be generated at startup upon the first reference_frame detection (from reference_frame to base_frame)
# The frame will be set up once at startup and stays fixed from that time on which prevents that robot rotations mess up the reference frame detection.
